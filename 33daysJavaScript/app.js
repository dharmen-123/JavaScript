// API Application Programming Interface 
// Through the API we can use the services from the server in our web  page 

// fetch (url and object )
// It done the get , post , delete , put and this all are known as http request / method 

// Synchronus and asychronus programming 
// Synchronus is run line by line 
// asychronus is run first the line of code which take less time 

// when the api hit the js then js work as asynchrous due the light weight
// to solve this problem use async or await
